Revision No: 01 IT301-0001-LM
Revision Date: November 24, 2025
Reference: Mapúa MCM Laboratory Manual

 I declare that the work presented in this portfolio is my original work. Where I have used AI-assisted tools (including but not limited to code-completion, code generation, design drafts), I have disclosed and attributed that use clearly and accurately within the portfolio.
   
 Disclosure statement
 I used GitHub Copilot to assist with code suggestions, debugging, and drafting project text (helper functions, fixes, and documentation). AI-assisted contributions appear in `css/styles.css` and `js/script.js` and are explicitly noted inline (or in file headers). I reviewed, tested, and edited all AI-assisted outputs and take responsibility for the final content.
